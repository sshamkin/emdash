/**
 * createFrameScheduler — a demand-driven, phased rAF loop.
 *
 * Enforces a strict read → animate → write phase ordering per frame so DOM
 * geometry reads (scrollTop/clientHeight) are always batched before any writes.
 * The loop re-schedules only when a phase signals more work is pending, so it
 * sleeps completely when the UI is idle (no battery cost from a perpetual rAF).
 *
 * Hardened invariants (aligned with CodeMirror's measure cycle):
 *
 * 1. Liveness-through-failure: phases run inside try/catch; the re-arm
 *    decision always executes in `finally` so a throwing phase cannot
 *    permanently stall the loop.
 *
 * 2. Bounded converge: if write returns true more than MAX_CONVERGE consecutive
 *    frames the loop stops re-arming to prevent a spin loop. A warning is
 *    logged in development.
 *
 * 3. Force-reconcile: `forceReconcile()` marks work pending and arms the loop.
 *    Call on view (re)attach or when the viewport becomes visible after being
 *    hidden (inert / visibility:hidden) to self-heal any missed wakes.
 *
 * Phases:
 *   read     — read DOM geometry once per frame into signals (shadow).
 *   animate  — advance all active tweens; return true while any remain active.
 *   write    — flush coalesced height total and apply at most one scroll write;
 *              return true if more write work was queued this tick.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   const scheduler = createFrameScheduler({ read, animate, write });
 *   scheduler.request();        // arm from any event handler or tween start
 *   scheduler.forceReconcile(); // re-arm + mark dirty on reattach/visibility
 *   scheduler.dispose();        // cancel in onCleanup
